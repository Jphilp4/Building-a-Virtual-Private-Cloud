# 🌐 Deploying a VPC with Internet Access: AWS Networking Project

---

## Project Overview  
I've designed and deployed an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create a **secure, scalable** network environment for hosting EC2 instances. This project involves setting up a public subnet, configuring IP addressing, and enabling internet access through an **Internet Gateway (IGW)**.

---

## Project Highlights  
### What I Did:  
- 🏗 **Created a Custom VPC**: Configured an isolated cloud network with a designated **CIDR block**.  
- 🌍 **Set Up Public Subnet & Routing**: Assigned **auto-public IPs** and established outbound traffic flow via an **Internet Gateway**.  
- 🔗 **Launched an EC2 Instance**: Deployed a virtual machine inside the public subnet.
- 🚀 **Verified Internet Connectivity**: Ensured traffic flow with correct **security groups** and **route tables**.

---

### Next Phase:  
- 🔒 **Security Enhancements**: Implement additional **NACLs, security groups, and IAM policies** to tighten access controls.  
- 📊 **Monitoring & Optimisation**: Implement AWS **CloudWatch** and **VPC Flow Logs** to analyse network performance and security.  
- 🏗 **VPC Peering & Private Networking**: Extend the network by linking multiple VPCs securely.

## Why Amazon VPC?  
Amazon VPC enables **flexible, secure** networking within AWS, allowing fine-grained control over resource accessibility. With **subnet isolation, custom routing, and scalable internet access**, it’s a crucial component for building robust cloud infrastructure.
